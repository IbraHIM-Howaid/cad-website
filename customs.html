Before you arrive in Canada you may be asked to
complete a Customs Declaration Card. You must
complete this card before you meet with customs
and immigration officials.
<br><br>
When you arrive in Canada, you will be
interviewed by a Customs Officer of the Canada
Border Services Agency. You will need to show
the officer your immigrant visa and a list of all the
household and personal items you are bringing
into Canada. The Customs Officer will then refer
you to an Immigration Officer.
<br><br>
The Immigration Officer will check your travel
documents and ask you questions to verify that
you are of good character and in good health. You may also be asked to show proof of
your funds. If there are no difficulties, the Immigration Officer will authorize your entry
to Canada as a permanent resident. If you arrive in Toronto, Montr√©al or Vancouver,
you will find immigrant reception services at the airport.
